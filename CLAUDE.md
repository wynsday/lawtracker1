# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # start Vite dev server (default localhost:5173)
npm run build        # tsc type-check + Vite production build
npm run preview      # serve the production build locally
npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit   # type-check only, no emit

# Seed the database (requires SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY in .env)
node --env-file=.env supabase/seed.mjs

# Deploy edge functions
npx supabase functions deploy auth-check
npx supabase functions deploy auth-signin
npx supabase functions deploy auth-validate
npx supabase functions deploy auth-sensitive
npx supabase functions deploy auth-signout
npx supabase functions deploy auth-register
npx supabase functions deploy auth-create-account
npx supabase functions deploy daily-refresh

# Notification system
npx supabase functions deploy push-subscribe
npx supabase functions deploy alert-settings-save
npx supabase functions deploy bill-status-sync
npx supabase functions deploy notifications-list
npx supabase functions deploy notifications-read
npx supabase functions deploy notify-send

# Generate VAPID keys (run once, then set secrets as instructed)
node scripts/gen-vapid.mjs
```

There are no tests. There is no linter config beyond the default Vite scaffold.

## Environment

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=           # Supabase project URL, exposed to browser
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY= # Supabase publishable key, exposed to browser
VITE_FUNCTIONS_BASE=           # Empty string in dev (uses Vite proxy); full Supabase URL in prod
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=           # Server-side only — seed script, edge functions
```

`src/lib/supabase.ts` throws at module load time if `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` or `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is missing.

**Dev proxy:** `VITE_FUNCTIONS_BASE=` (empty string) activates `vite.config.ts`'s `server.proxy` rule, which forwards `/functions/v1/*` to the Supabase project URL. This makes auth requests same-origin in the browser, which is required for `SameSite=Strict` cookies to work locally. **Always restart the dev server after changing `.env`.**

**Supabase secrets** (set via `supabase secrets set KEY=value`, not `.env`):
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` — the app's public URL, used in CORS headers for credentialed requests
- `ADMIN_SECRET` — protects the `auth-create-account` edge function

## Data Model — Two Layers

### Layer 1 — Auto-pulled (official sources only)
Fields populated and updated by the daily edge function cron:
- `name` (bill number + title), `introduced`, `stage`, `stage_dates`, `stage_note`
- Federal source: api.congress.gov
- Michigan source: legislature.mi.gov (LegiScan as fallback)
- **Never pull from unofficial sources.**

### Layer 2 — Human-written (never auto-overwritten)
Fields that only a human sets via the admin UI:
- `bill_desc`, `decisions`, `supporters`, `blockers`, `influence_window`, `policy_bias`, `urgency`
- The daily pull must never touch these fields, even during a hard refresh.

---

## Bills Table — Verification Columns

Migration `002_add_verification_columns.sql` adds to the `bills` table:

```sql
verified          boolean     not null default false,
verified_by       text,        -- human moniker e.g. "SL" or "Margaret"
verified_at       timestamptz,
last_pulled_at    timestamptz,
pull_source       text,        -- URL used in the most recent pull
raw_pull_data     jsonb,       -- full snapshot from source at last pull
pending_changes   jsonb,       -- diff object; null means no pending changes
source_url        text,
notes             text
```

---

## Verification Rules

- One checkbox per card — verifies the entire card at once, not individual fields.
- Verified cards display a checkmark and the `verified_by` moniker publicly on the card.
- **Verified cards are read-only to the auto-pull.** The nightly job stores diffs in `pending_changes` instead of writing to the live card.
- **Hard refresh** (manual, admin-only): overwrites all Layer 1 fields directly and clears `verified` regardless of what changed.
- Any human edit to any field clears `verified`, `verified_by`, and `verified_at` automatically.

---

## 3am Soft Update — Edge Function Behavior

The `daily-refresh` edge function runs at 08:00 UTC (3 AM US Eastern) via pg_cron. Behavior differs by `verified` status:

**Unverified cards:**
1. Pull from official source.
2. Overwrite all Layer 1 fields directly.
3. Leave `verified = false` unchanged.

**Verified cards:**
1. Pull from official source.
2. Compare each Layer 1 field to the live card value.
3. If any field changed: write the diff to `pending_changes` only. **Do not touch the live card or clear `verified`.**
4. If nothing changed: do nothing. Leave `verified` and `pending_changes` alone.
5. The public always sees the verified version until a human accepts the diff.

---

## Verifier UI — Logged-in Users Only

Verified cards that have a non-null `pending_changes` show a dot indicator on the card.

Expanding the diff shows a field-by-field comparison (old → new). Three actions:

- **Accept All** — applies all Layer 1 changes from `pending_changes`, clears `verified` (card becomes unverified), clears `pending_changes`.
- **Edit Fields** — opens the Layer 1 fields inline pre-populated with the incoming values; verifier can modify before saving. Saving clears `pending_changes` but also clears `verified` (requires re-verification).
- **Skip** — dismisses the diff view until the next pull cycle. Live card is unchanged.

---

## Architecture

This is a React PWA backed by Supabase. Routing uses react-router-dom with three routes: `/` (tracker), `/login`, `/register`.

**Data flow:** `useBills` hook (in `TrackerPage.tsx`) → Supabase PostgREST → `Bill[]` → `filterBills()` → rendered cards.

**Auth flow:** `main.tsx` wraps everything in `BrowserRouter` → `AuthProvider` → `App`. On every page load, `AuthContext` calls `auth-validate` (reads httpOnly cookie automatically) to restore session.

---

## Custom Auth System

All auth uses a custom accounts table — **not Supabase Auth**. Sessions are httpOnly cookies (`wsp_session`), never exposed to JavaScript.

### Two-credential design
Each account has both a **password** and a **passcode**. On login, `auth-check` reads the existing `wsp_session` cookie:
- Cookie matches DB token → device is recognized → prompt for passcode (faster, daily use)
- No cookie or expired → prompt for password (new device or session expired)
- Locked → force password entry to unlock

### Session lifecycle
- 45-day rolling window: `auth-validate` re-issues the cookie with a fresh `Max-Age` on every page load while the session is active.
- `remember=false` on sign-in: cookie has no `Max-Age` (session cookie, cleared on browser close).
- `auth-signout` nulls the token in the DB and sets `Max-Age=0` — required because JS cannot clear httpOnly cookies.

### Passcode lockout
5 consecutive failed passcode attempts locks the account. Entering the correct password unlocks it and resets the counter.

### Credential hashing
PBKDF2-SHA256, 100,000 iterations, random 16-byte salt per credential, stored as `saltHex:hashHex`. Implemented in `supabase/functions/_shared/auth-utils.ts`.

### Edge functions
All auth edge functions are in `supabase/functions/auth-*/index.ts`. They share utilities from `supabase/functions/_shared/auth-utils.ts`:
- `auth-check` — device recognition (cookie → passcode or password mode)
- `auth-signin` — validates credential, issues session cookie
- `auth-validate` — session guard, rolls the 45-day window forward
- `auth-sensitive` — password re-verification for sensitive actions
- `auth-signout` — clears session server-side + cookie Max-Age=0
- `auth-register` — public self-registration, rate-limited 3/hour/IP, always tier=1 role=user
- `auth-create-account` — admin-only (requires `ADMIN_SECRET`), can set role/tier

### Database tables
- `accounts` — uuid PK, username (unique), password_hash, passcode_hash, email (unique), role (`'user'|'verifier'|'admin'`), tier (int), session_token, session_expires_at, failed_passcode_attempts, passcode_locked. RLS enabled; service_role only.
- `registration_rate_limits` — ip_hash (PK, SHA-256), attempts, window_start. Rows older than 2 hours are deleted on each registration attempt. RLS enabled; service_role only.

### CORS and cookies
`auth-utils.ts` sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ${ALLOWED_ORIGIN}` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`. In development the Vite proxy removes the need for CORS entirely — requests arrive at Supabase from the proxy server, not from the browser.

## Key Non-Obvious Design Decisions

**CSS is verbatim from a source HTML file.** `src/tracker.css` is a direct copy of the original `Michigan_National_Tracker_08_May_26.html` stylesheet. Do not replace it with Tailwind utility classes. `src/index.css` only contains `@import './tracker.css'` — the Tailwind directives were intentionally removed to avoid a base-style reset that would break the design. Tailwind is installed but unused for tracker components. Auth page styles live in `src/auth.css`, imported separately in `main.tsx`.

**`policyBarStyle()` returns a CSS string, not a React style object.** `BillCard.tsx` contains a local `parseCssStyle()` helper that converts it to `React.CSSProperties` before use as an inline style. This exists because `policyBarStyle` was designed to be embedded directly in HTML attributes in the original file.

**Filter chip labels ≠ data values.** Several filters map UI labels to different DB values:
- Timing chip "Session" → filters on `urgency === 'year'` (not `'session'`)
- Impact chip "Due process / 14th" → matches bills with `'due'` OR `'14th'` in the `amend` array
- City sub-filter only applies when `level === 'local'`

**`stage` is 0-indexed and the length encodes enactment.** `stage === stages.length` means the bill is enacted/signed. The stage arrays differ by level: Federal has 6 stages, Michigan and Local have 5. `Pipeline.tsx` selects the correct array based on `bill.level`.

**Download HTML feature.** `Header.tsx` offers a "Download HTML" button that calls `generateHtml(bills, stateName, today)` from `src/lib/generateHtml.ts`. This function re-serializes the current filtered bill data back into the original standalone HTML format (including all CSS and JS) so the file works offline without any server. The DB uses snake_case; `generateHtml.ts` converts back to the camelCase field names the original HTML's embedded JS expects.

## Supabase Schema Notes

The `bills` table has RLS enabled. The schema grants are required in addition to the RLS policy — both must be present:

```sql
grant select on bills to anon, authenticated;   -- frontend reads
grant all    on bills to service_role;           -- seed + edge function writes
```

The edge function `supabase/functions/daily-refresh/index.ts` currently stubs the LegiScan API call (it just touches `updated_at`). The cron schedule targets 8:00 UTC (3 AM US Eastern).

## Adding a New State

1. Add seed data rows with the appropriate `state` char(2) code and `level` values.
2. Update `useBills` call in `src/pages/TrackerPage.tsx` to include the new state code.
3. Add any state-specific pipeline stages to `src/lib/constants.ts` if needed.
4. Update `OFFICE_META` and `CITY_FILTERS` for local jurisdictions in that state.

## Vendor Restrictions
- No Google APIs or Google services anywhere in the stack
- No Palantir products or APIs
- For address to district lookup: use Census Geocoding API
- For mapping: OpenStreetMap / Leaflet only
- For analytics: Plausible self-hosted only
- All vendor names stay out of public-facing copy

---

## Data Privacy Rules — Non-Negotiable
- No third party analytics, tracking pixels, or session recording
- No advertising networks or SDKs of any kind
- No social share buttons that make external calls on page load
- All user data stays in our Supabase instance
- The only permitted external data call involving user info is Census Geocoding API for district lookup
- Every feature must be evaluated for external data exposure before being built

---

## Data Model — Two Layers (Policy)
Layer 1 (auto-pulled, official sources only):
- Federal bills: api.congress.gov
- Michigan bills: legislature.mi.gov, LegiScan as fallback
- Fields: bill number, title, sponsors, stage, stage dates, vote counts, stageNote
- Never pull from unofficial sources

Layer 2 (human-written, never auto-overwritten):
- Fields: desc, decisions, supporters, blockers, window, policyBias, urgency
- Only set or changed by a human in admin UI

---

## Verification Rules (Policy)
- One checkbox per card, verifies the whole card at once
- Verified status and verifier moniker visible in admin view only
- Never shown on public card
- Verified cards are read-only to auto-pull
- Hard refresh: overwrites all Layer 1 fields, clears verified regardless of what changed
- Any human edit clears verification automatically

---

## Role Permissions
- Public: read cards and change log only
- Tier 1 Account: Alert/Watch/Archive per card, personal comment box
- Tier 2 Verified Account: verified badge, district info, dates timeline
- Verifier role: check/uncheck verified checkbox, re-pull button, notes block only
- Admin role: full write on all fields, assign roles, view aggregates

---

## 3am Soft Update Rules (Policy)
- Unverified cards: overwrite all Layer 1 fields directly
- Verified cards: store diff in pending_changes only, never touch live card
- No mass delete ever — bills not in pull stay in system
- Bills not touched by pull and not verified get a unique color flag
- One change log entry per day, deleted after 8 days

---

## Per-Card User Controls
- Three selections: Alert, Watch, Archive
- Personal comment box: 1500 chars, visible to user only
- Send to aggregate: anonymous with tracking number, or with account data
- Bot detection: flag accounts sending more than one comment per day
- Keyword notifications: up to 10 keywords, 5 typed free-form, 5 from filter chips
- One daily digest maximum for keyword matches

---

## Design Source of Truth
- `Michigan_National_Tracker_08_May_26.html` is the visual reference
- App must match exactly: CSS variables, card layout, filter chips, pipeline stages, policy bias bar, urgency colors, office dot system
- Verified status is never shown on public cards
